Some games to help lazy students learning French ;-)


The Memory game is coded with vanilla JS/CSS/HTML and based on marina-ferreira's tutorial.
This game offers additionnal functions : replay button, score and click counter, winning pop-up. 
It's also responsive, using flexbox layout.

The purpose is to associate basic French sentences with images, avoiding the student to go through his/her native langage to learn. 
This helps with langage desynchronization and is inspired from the ANL method.
