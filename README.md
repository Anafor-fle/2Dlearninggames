Some games to help lazy students learning French ;-)


The Memory game is coded with vanilla JS/CSS/HTML and based on marina-ferreira's tutorial.
This game offers additionnal functions : replay button, score and click counter, winning pop-up. 
It's also responsive, using flexbox layout.

The purpose is to associate basic French sentences with images, avoiding the student to go through his/her native langage to learn. 
This helps with langage desynchronization and is inspired from the ANL method.


The Meteo game is is coded with vanilla JS/CSS/HTML.
It displays weather data from 3 main french speaking cities (Montr√©al, Brazzaville and Brussels), using openWeather API. 
The player must associate the right description of the weather, selecting an option within a dropdown list. 
The game was build with a mobile first approach and css-grid.

This very quick game can be played every day, or even several times per day. 
It will help the student to repete those key sentences for casual conversation on a daily basis.
Repetion is central to keep knowledge in our immediate memory !
